heightened-sense
================

A very simple web GUI aimed at Hisense MP800H (should work on other media players) using the built in webserver and as little actual hacking as possible.

The goal is to allow any device with a web browser to act as a remote control for the media player. Ultimately I would like to allow complete control and provide an alternate GUI.

Uses jQuery.
